# AI Learning Goals

## - Week 1 (29th Jan to 4th Feb):
- [X] Naked Statistics (Charles Wheelan)
- [X] Fast.ai (Online Course Part 1)
- [ ] Introduction to AI (Udacity Course) [60% complete]

## - Week 2 (5th Feb - 11th Feb):
- [X] Deep Learning (Udacity Course)
- [X] CS 188 (Youtube videos)
- [X] Intro to Machine Learning (Udacity Course)

## - Week 3 (12th Feb - 18th Feb):
- [X] Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow) [Part 1]
- [X] CS231N Stanford [With Assignments]
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning (David Silver or CS294) [80% Done]

## - Week 4 (19th Feb - 25th Feb):
Took the week off to learn more about
- Probability Theory
- Information Theory
- Implemented Char RNN (Karpathy's Blog)
- Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)

## - Week 5 (26th Feb - 4th March): 
- [X] Read Papers [1 - 2 papers] (Batch Normalization and Training very Deep Networks)

##### I think at this point I realised that I did not have enough mathematical knowledge to go deeper into the subject. So I am taking a deviation from the original path and taking some time to develop the mathematical knowledge.

## - Week 6 (5th March - 11th March):
- [X] Think Stats [Allen B. Downey]

## - Week 7 (12th March - 18th March):
- [X] Introduction to Statistical Learning

## - Week 8 (19th March - 25th March):
- [ ] All of Statistics (Wasserman)

## - Week 9 (26th March - April 1st):
- Backlogs 

### Going to get rid of weekly system from this point and use steps (Which will probably be equivalent to a week's worth of work)

## Step 1
- [ ] Introduction to Probability **[Bertsekas]**
- [ ] Any good book on R
- Possibly Learn Julia

## Step 2
- [ ] Linear Algebra Book **[Strang]**

## Step 3
- [ ] Elements of Statistical Learning
- [ ] The Art of Computer Programming **[Volume 1]**

## Step 4
- [ ] Mathematical Analysis **[Rudin]**
- [ ] The Art of Computer Programming **[Volume 2]**

## Step 5
- [ ] Convex Optimization **[Boyd]**
- [ ] How to Solve It **[Polya]**

## Step 5
- [ ] Information Theory **[Mackay]**
